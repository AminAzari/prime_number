if you dont use
---------------------------
  if( sA-A(js)+2*A(je)>n)
                disp([js,je])
                flag=1;
                break
 end
 ---------------------------
 it will take 15 seconds.
 
 Note: we are not using any matrix :-)
 If results are saved in matrix, it will give memory overflow.
